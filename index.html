            <p>The family began their journey in the city of ilorin where the father, Mr Godwin Jagboro is residence as
                a young man.
                He decided to get married to a beautiful lady by name Christiana in her 20's who is from ukwagbe, delta
                state while he is from Effrun
                town,delta state. The coming together of this couple was the amazing begining of this family. They had
                their first
                three children in ilorin and the last four in kaduna state. </p>

                They gave birth to their first daughter in 1990 and the named her ONOME which means mother. <br>
                Their second child was also a girl child and she was conceived in 1993, they named her ONAJOMO meaning
                <q>A male is not the only sex for children, female too are children</q>. This was because
                they were expecting a male child yet God blessed them with a female child. So the decided to still take
                care
                of her very well even though she was a female knowing that its not only a male that is a child female
                too are
                children.
            </p>
            <p>Their third child was also a girl and was conceived in 1996, she was named ONAKEME meaning
                <q>My time has come.</q> This name became a name of prophecy since they had being looking for a boy
                child.
                it truly became their time, because after her was a boy child.
            </p>
            <p>After the birth of their first three children they left ilorin for kaduna due to the
                continuous incoming contracts from kaduna. Late Mr Godwin Jagboro spent most of his time in kaduna after
                the birth of their third child, so he decided to relocate to kaduna with his family so as to spend more
                time
                with his family in 1998. The first child they gave birth too in kaduna happens to be a boy, finally
                their
                prayers has ben answered. They named their first male child BRUME meaning "God has given me my own
                inheritance".
                Their remaining four children where given birth to in kaduna in 2001, 2004 and 2007 respectively. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The next after brume was a boy named EFE meaning <q> My wealth has come</q>, follwed by a girl named
                Omavonwa
                meaning<q>shame to the devil</q> and their last child was a girl and was named UFUOMA meaning
                <q>Peace.</q> This is
                the entire family of Late Mr Godwin Jagboro
